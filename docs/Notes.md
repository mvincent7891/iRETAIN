# Notes

# TODO (Sep 8):
- Adding decks from search results (broken after subject integration)
- Search results currently produce duplicates

## Issues - August 29
- Can't change '.IO' font in logo for some reason
- Still haven't figured out the right nav ul not taking up its entire container (css issue)
- Errors aren't displaying on login/signup forms (fixed errors for cards)
- Cards should be lit up for a moment after creation
- Only one card should be expanded at once (need to move select logic from index item up to index)
- Bugs with lookup: looking up a blank title sometimes autofills the last looked up word; saving a blank body autofills the last lookup
- Both of the above may be fixed with a solo lookup redux cycle
